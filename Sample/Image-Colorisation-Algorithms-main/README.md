<!--<h3><b>Colorful Image Colorization</b></h3>-->
## <b>Colorize Black & White Images using Deep Learning with Python <br>
following approach [By Richard Zhang ECCV, 2016](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.08511.pdf).

**+ automatic colorization functionality for Real-Time User-Guided Image Colorization with Learned Deep Priors, SIGGRAPH 2017!**

## Lab Color Space:
Like RGB, Lab is another color space. It is also three channel color space like RGB where the channels are:

L channel: This channel represents the Lightness
a channel: This channel represents green-red
b channel: This channel represents blue-yellow

## Why we chose LAB color space
In this color space, the grayscale part of the image is only encoded in L channel. Therefore Lab color space is more favorable for our project.

**Clone the repository; install dependencies**

```
git clone https://github.com/vaibhavhariaramani/Image-Colorisation-Algorithms.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Colorize!** This script will colorize an image. The results should match the images in the `imgs_out` folder.

```
python script1.py -i Sample/1in.jpg
```

**Model loading in Python** The following loads pretrained colorizers. See [script1.py](script1.py) for some details on how to run the model. There are some pre and post-processing steps: convert to Lab space, resize to 256x256, colorize, and concatenate to the original full resolution, and convert to RGB.

```python
import colorizers
colorizer_eccv16 = colorizers.eccv16().eval()
colorizer_siggraph17 = colorizers.siggraph17().eval()
```
